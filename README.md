# Poesie

If Magnetic Poetry and Instagram had a baby, it would be Poesie: a full stack poetry app that enables users to create poems by dragging and dropping words that were randomly generated by the [Wordnik API.](https://developer.wordnik.com/) Users are also able to save poems to their profile page, upload profile photos from their local computer, browse and like other usersâ€™ poems, and follow one another. Poesie utilizes JWT and bcrypt for user authentication and authorization, which enables users to securely log in and view their saved poems.

## Getting Started

To use Poesie, first fork and clone the Rails backend, which is in this repo. Next, run `bundle install` in the command line and launch Postgres. Once Postgres is running, create your own secret key in an .env file. Then, run `rails db:create && rails db:migrate`, followed by `rails db:seed`. Finally, run `rails s -p 4000`, which will launch the API on a local server at the specified port.

Once you have the backend running, fork and clone the React+Redux frontend, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ensallee/poesie_frontend). Before you proceed, request your own API key from [Wordnik]((https://developer.wordnik.com/) and adjust the routes accordingly to complete successful queries. Next, run `npm install` in the command line. Then, run `npm start`. As long as you seeded your database when setting up the backend, you can log in as 'guest' with the password 'password'.
